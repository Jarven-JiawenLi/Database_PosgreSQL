## P1_customer_360.sql:
This is the project that I did in this course for which it analyze cutomer lifetime value. 
It is a valid forecast of a customer's future profits and is used to measure how valuable a customer (user) is to the organization over a period of time.

This SQL script is structured to analyze customer behavior in terms of conversions and orders.
It aims to link conversion events (like subscribing or making a purchase) with specific order details, providing a comprehensive view of customer activity.
The script for a Customer 360 view, to understand and analyze customer interactions and behaviors across various touchpoints.

I utilized ROW_NUMBER(), and LEAD() functions, partitioned by customer_id and ordered by conversion_date to analyze reccurrence and sequence of conversion.
I did time frame analysis, date-related analysis, and order-week analysis to provide a comprehensive view on customer engagements and interactions.
