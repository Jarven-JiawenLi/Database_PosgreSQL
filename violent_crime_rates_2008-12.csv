Footnotes:,,,,,,
1,"For the period from 1998 to 2008 Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) data are not available for all respondents. In order to report this level of detail for police services still reporting to the Aggregate Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (URC) over this time, a process of imputation was applied to derive counts for violations that do not exist on their own in the aggregate survey. For approximately 80% of the aggregate offence codes, there is a 1:1 mapping with a new incident-based violation code. For violations where this was not the case, such as the aggregate other Criminal Code category, it was necessary to estimate (impute) this figure using the distribution of other Criminal Code offences from existing Incident-based UCR2 respondents.",,,,,
2,"During the production of each year's crime statistics, data from the previous year are revised to reflect any updates or changes that have been received from the police services.",,,,,
3,"The methodology for calculating census metropolitan area (CMA) populations was modified in 2003. Starting in 1996, the populations for CMAs have been adjusted to reflect the actual policing boundaries within the CMA and do not reflect the official Statistics Canada population for these CMAs. CMA data are included within province-level data.",,,,,
54,"Police reported statistics may be affected by differences in the way police services deal with minor offences. In some instances, police or municipalities might chose to deal with some minor offences using municipal by-laws or provincial provisions rather than Criminal Code provisions. Counts are based on the most serious violation in the incident.",,,,,
50,"In 2012, it was discovered that the Montreal Police Service had been incorrectly applying the agreed upon definition for reporting child pornography incidents to the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR). As such, the number of violations has been revised for the years 2008 to 2011.",,,,,
16,"The violent crime category has been expanded under the Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) to include a number of offences not previously included in the violent crime category, including uttering threats, criminal harassment and forcible confinement. Therefore, total violent crime counts in this table will not match total violent crime counts from the Aggregate Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (URC).",,,,,
17,"Homicide data are extracted from the homicide survey database. For further information, refer to: http://www.statcan.gc.ca/imdb-bmdi/3315-eng.htm.",,,,,
24,"In general, the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) counts any adult and youth charged for the year in which the charge was laid. The homicide totals, which come from The Homicide Survey, count any adult or youth charged with a homicide that occurred in the reference year, regardless of when the charge was laid.",,,,,
26,"Sexual violations against children is a new crime category with only partial data available prior to 2008. As a result, numbers and rates should not be directly compared to data from previous years.",,,,,
48,"In August 2012, legislation came into effect making it an offence to make sexually explicit material available to a child for the purpose of facilitating sexual offences against children/youth. The Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) introduced a new violation code to collect this information.",,,,,
25,"Any reference to Police Officer has been changed to read Peace Officer, as per the Canadian Criminal Code. Peace officer refers to any person employed for the preservation and maintenance of the public peace or for the service or execution of civil process. Examples of a Peace Officer are a mayor, warden, police officer, or bailiff constable. Please see the Canadian Criminal Code for a complete list of designates.",,,,,
35,"In 2009, legislation was introduced to create the offences of assault with a weapon or causing bodily harm to a peace officer (level 2) and aggravated assault to a peace officer (level 3). The introduction of these new codes into the UCR Survey created a system anomaly which resulted in some non-peace officer assaults being coded as peace officer assaults in 2010. Comparisons to 2010 should be made with caution.",,,,,
18,Robbery counts have been revised for the years 1998 to 2007. This change has resulted in an increase of approximately 12% annually in the number of reported robbery incidents for this time period. Use caution when comparing these data with prior years.,,,,,
34,"Historically police services have reported kidnapping and forcible confinement under a single combined violation code. In 2008 the Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) introduced separate codes for these violations which police services utilize as their Records Management Systems are updated to allow them. As a result, comparison with previous years should be done with caution.",,,,,
36,"For the period from 1998 to 2007 Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) data on criminal harassment are not available for all respondents. In order to report this violation for police services still reporting to the aggregate Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) over this time, a process of imputation was applied to derive counts using the distribution of 'other' Criminal Code offences from existing Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) respondents.",,,,,
51,"In 2012, Charlottetown altered the classification of calls from the public regarding impaired driving which accounts for the decrease at the municipal and provincial levels that year.",,,,,
7,"During the revision of 2001 data for the province of Ontario, a discrepancy in methodology applied by the forces in the province using the Ontario Municipal and Provincial Police Automated Co-operative (OMPPAC) system was detected. These forces report approximately one-third of the total criminal incidents for the province and include the Ontario Provincial Police and about 60 small and mid-sized municipal forces. This discrepancy resulted in an over-count of less serious criminal incidents. During 2003 and 2004, the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics (CCJS) consulted with affected police services and analyzed both historical Aggregate Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) data and more recent Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) microdata to determine the impact of this over-reporting. The effect at the Canada level was, on average, 1% per year from 1977 to 2000. This over-counting peaked in 1991, where it was estimated that the total crime rate for the country was over-estimated by approximately 1.8%. However, the overall historical trend changed very little. The impact in Ontario is more noticeable, but the overall trend is still very similar. On average, the effect was 2% to 3% per year, with the biggest change occurring in 1991, where the Ontario crime rate is 5% lower as a result of the adjustment. For further information, refer to the report:<A HREF=""http://www.statcan.gc.ca/imdb-bmdi/document/3302_D13_T9_V1-eng.pdf"">Summary of Historical Adjustments to Crime Data for Ontario 1977-2000</A>.",,,,,

52,"Ottawa numbers also include child pornography incidents reported by the National Child Exploitation Coordination Centre of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) which is located in the City of Ottawa. The Centre responds to internet-facilitated sexual abuse cases nationally. Therefore, while the incidents are detected by the RCMP Centre located in Ottawa and appear in Ottawa's crime statistics, the incidents themselves or the offenders are not limited to the city of Ottawa.",,,,,
8,"Abbotsford-Mission, British Columbia and Kingston, Ontario became new census metropolitan areas (CMAs) as of the 2001 Census. Moncton, New Brunswick, Peterborough, Ontario, Brantford, Ontario, Guelph, Ontario, Barrie, Ontario, and Kelowna, British Columbia became new CMAs as of the 2006 Census.",,,,,
33,"In 2009, slight changes were made to the respondent-to-CMA mapping for this census metropolitan area (CMA) which have resulted in minor revisions to previously published data.",,,,,
11,"Prior to 1999, a number of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) detachments in Saskatchewan were double counting the number of actual offences of impaired driving. This over-counting was corrected in 1999, therefore, comparisons with previous years should be made with caution. It is recommended that the analysis of impaired driving be based on persons charged data rather than actual offences.",,,,,
28,"Youth crime in British Columbia may be somewhat undercounted due to the Crown charge-approval system in place whereby, even for minor offences, there must be approval by the Crown before charges are laid after police have made an arrest. This approval is based on the substantial likelihood of conviction.",,,,,
